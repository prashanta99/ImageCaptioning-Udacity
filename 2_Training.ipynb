    "### Task #1\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by setting the following variables:\n",
    "- `batch_size` - the batch size of each training batch.  It is the number of image-caption pairs used to amend the model weights in each training step. \n",
    "- `vocab_threshold` - the minimum word count threshold.  Note that a larger threshold will result in a smaller vocabulary, whereas a smaller threshold will include rarer words and result in a larger vocabulary.  \n",
    "- `vocab_from_file` - a Boolean that decides whether to load the vocabulary from file. \n",
    "- `embed_size` - the dimensionality of the image and word embeddings.  \n",
    "- `hidden_size` - the number of features in the hidden state of the RNN decoder.  \n",
    "- `num_epochs` - the number of epochs to train the model.  We recommend that you set `num_epochs=3`, but feel free to increase or decrease this number as you wish.  [This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) trained a captioning model on a single state-of-the-art GPU for 3 days, but you'll soon see that you can get reasonable results in a matter of a few hours!  (_But of course, if you want your model to compete with current research, you will have to train for much longer._)\n",
    "- `save_every` - determines how often to save the model weights.  We recommend that you set `save_every=1`, to save the model weights after each epoch.  This way, after the `i`th epoch, the encoder and decoder weights will be saved in the `models/` folder as `encoder-i.pkl` and `decoder-i.pkl`, respectively.\n",
    "- `print_every` - determines how often to print the batch loss to the Jupyter notebook while training.  Note that you **will not** observe a monotonic decrease in the loss function while training - this is perfectly fine and completely expected!  You are encouraged to keep this at its default value of `100` to avoid clogging the notebook, but feel free to change it.\n",
    "- `log_file` - the name of the text file containing - for every step - how the loss and perplexity evolved during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not sure where to begin to set some of the values above, you can peruse [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) and [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf) for useful guidance!  **To avoid spending too long on this notebook**, you are encouraged to consult these suggested research papers to obtain a strong initial guess for which hyperparameters are likely to work best.  Then, train a single model, and proceed to the next notebook (**3_Inference.ipynb**).  If you are unhappy with your performance, you can return to this notebook to tweak the hyperparameters (and/or the architecture in **model.py**) and re-train your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Describe your CNN-RNN architecture in detail.  With this architecture in mind, how did you select the values of the variables in Task 1?  If you consulted a research paper detailing a successful implementation of an image captioning model, please provide the reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "For this project I used the knowledge gained from the modules of \"Advanced Computer Vision and Deep Learning\" also from the suggested article [Show and Tell: A Neural Image Caption Generator] (https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4555)\n",
    "This Image Captioning model use combination of **CNN-RNN** architecture. Using this architecture we leverage\n",
    "the strengths of both CNN and RNN to process Images and Sequential data respectively.\n",
    "The CNN model plays the role of Encoder and the RNN model plays the role of Decoder.\n",
    "A pretrained <em>resnet50</em> model was used for CNN and its last flattened Linear o/p with features was used as input to the RNN. **LSTM** flavor is used instead of the vanilla RNN to avoid issues of vanishing or exploding gradients. \n",
    "No Modification was done to CNN model parameters as those parameters were similar to the ones I used for Face Recorgnition project before and had worked quite well plus resetnet50 model is quite efficient and successful model for image processing.\n",
    "The LSTM used single layer architecture with one Linear layer which gives the softmax output equal to the size of the vocabulary. I Tried using dropout but realized it requires num_layers greater than one. At this point I did not go ahead with this change but have taken note of it.\n",
    "The features are processed using embedding layer and are stacked along with the captions (which too are processed via word embedding) to form the input data for the LSTM. Word Embedding is used to generate vectors of embed size for every word.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decisions for the values of the hyperparameters were based on \n",
    "1. knowledge from the module \"Hyperparameters\" and\n",
    "2. Article [Show and Tell: A Neural Image Caption Generator] (https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4555) and\n",
    "3. Some testing results\n",
    "\n",
    " * **batch_size = 128**           # One of the graphs in \"Hyperparameters\" module suggested 128 gives good results\n",
    " * **vocab_threshold = 5**        # Initially I tried 4 but did not worked well, 5 did quite well, but have not tested in isolation\n",
    " * **vocab_from_file = True**     # This option was observed to be faster that the alternative(False) when running the prelimanaries notebook\n",
    "\n",
    " * **embed_size  = 512**          # dimensionality of image and word embeddings - \n",
    " * **hidden_size = 512**          # number of features in hidden state of the RNN decoder - <br> \n",
    "\t* I tested with embed_size=256 and hidden_size=512 and it did not worked well, perplexity was high (> 20)\n",
    "    * Keeping the size of embed and hidden layers made significant difference in achieving low perplexity. (6.8)\n",
    "    * In the article the authors have kept same embed and hidden size\n",
    "\n",
    " * **num_epochs = 3**             # number of training epochs (**NO CHANGES** made, num_epochs = 2 would also have worked)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### (Optional) Task #2\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we have provided a recommended image transform `transform_train` for pre-processing the training images, but you are welcome (and encouraged!) to modify it as you wish.  When modifying this transform, keep in mind that:\n",
    "- the images in the dataset have varying heights and widths, and \n",
    "- if using a pre-trained model, you must perform the corresponding appropriate normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the transform in `transform_train`?  If you left the transform at its provided value, why do you think that it is a good choice for your CNN architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "**No Changes** were done to the transform function for two reasons\n",
    "  * The transform changes were quite similar to the ones I used in the CNN project \"Facial Key Point Detection\". They worked very well.\n",
    "  * The CNN model uses resnet50 model which is quite deep so I expected the parameters will work quite well for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #3\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will specify a Python list containing the learnable parameters of the model.  For instance, if you decide to make all weights in the decoder trainable, but only want to train the weights in the embedding layer of the encoder, then you should set `params` to something like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "params = list(decoder.parameters()) + list(encoder.embed.parameters()) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the trainable parameters of your architecture?  Why do you think this is a good choice?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "As per the CNN model (the Encoder), we used the pre-trained model (resnet50), so there was no need to train weights for this model except at the embedding layer. For the LSTM model (the Decoder) since we created it from scratch we need to have all the parameters trained. This was the reason we selected all parameters of LSTM and just the embed layer parameters of the CNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #4\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you will select an [optimizer](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/optim.html#torch.optim.Optimizer).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the optimizer used to train your model?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "I did two test with SGD Optimizer with learning rate 0.01 and it did not work well. One thing I missed here was to change the learning rate to 0.001 which I did for Adam optimizer. With SGD, the perplexity started very high and took time to read below 50 but it did not go less than 10 at any time\n",
    "When using Adam perplexity went low quite early and after using learning rate of 0.001 it was able to bring it to as low as 6.8. When using Adam with learning rate of 0.01 I observed the perplexity oscillating between 10 and 20 for whole one and half epoch with loss between 2 and 4. This was reason to decreased the learning rate to 0.001 and it gave a successful result."

For now, we strongly encourage you to train your model for the suggested 3 epochs without worrying about performance; then, you should immediately transition to the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**) to see how your model performs on the test data.  If your model needs to be changed, you can come back to this notebook, amend hyperparameters (if necessary), and re-train the model.\n",

In the next (optional) step of this notebook, we provide some guidance for assessing the performance on the validation dataset."

    "To assess potential overfitting, one approach is to assess performance on a validation set.  If you decide to do this **optional** task, you are required to first complete all of the steps in the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**); as part of that notebook, you will write and test code (specifically, the `sample` method in the `DecoderRNN` class) that uses your RNN decoder to generate captions.  That code will prove incredibly useful here. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you decide to validate your model, please do not edit the data loader in **data_loader.py**.  Instead, create a new file named **data_loader_val.py** containing the code for obtaining the data loader for the validation data.  You can access:\n",
    "- the validation images at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/images/train2014/'`, and\n",
    "- the validation image caption annotation file at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/annotations/captions_val2014.json'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The suggested approach to validating your model involves creating a json file such as [this one](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi/blob/master/results/captions_val2014_fakecap_results.json) containing your model's predicted captions for the validation images.  Then, you can write your own script or use one that you [find online](https://github.com/tylin/coco-caption) to calculate the BLEU score of your model.  You can read more about the BLEU score, along with other evaluation metrics (such as TEOR and Cider) in section 4.1 of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf).  For more information about how to use the annotation file, check out the [website](http://cocodataset.org/#download) for the COCO dataset."
